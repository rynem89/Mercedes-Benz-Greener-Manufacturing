Optimizing Mercedes-Benz Test Bench Time
**Problem Statement
Mercedes-Benz seeks to reduce the time cars spend on the test bench to enhance efficiency and decrease carbon emissions without compromising safety standards. The goal is to develop an algorithm that accurately predicts testing time for various car configurations.
Data Analysis and Modeling Approach
Data Preprocessing
•	Remove Zero-Variance Features: Identify and eliminate columns with no variation in values.
•	Handle Missing Values: Address null values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, removal).
•	Label Encoding: Convert categorical features into numerical representations.
Feature Engineering
•	Create New Features: Explore creating new features that might improve predictive power.
•	Incorporate Domain Knowledge: Consider domain knowledge and relationships between existing features.
Dimensionality Reduction
•	Use techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data, improving computational efficiency and potentially enhancing model performance.
XGBoost Modeling
•	Train an XGBoost model on the preprocessed data.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of estimators) for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate the model using metrics like MSE, RMSE, or MAE.
•	Cross-Validation: Employ cross-validation to assess generalization.
